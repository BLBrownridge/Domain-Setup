# Domain-Setup

1. Start from the Server Manager home page and click on "Add Roles."

2. Follow the wizard's prompts, clicking 'Next' until you reach the "Server Selection" screen. Ensure that your PC's name is selected and then click 'Next.'

3. Choose the role 'Active Directory Domain Services' and click 'Add Feature.'

4. Continue to the 'Confirmation' section, and click 'Install.'

5. After the installation is complete, click 'Close,' and you'll see on the Server home page that the role has been added.

Now, it's time to configure Active Directory Domain Services for use. Please note that it does not come preconfigured:

6. Click on the flag icon with a hazard symbol and select 'Promote this server to a domain.'

2. Choose 'Add forest' and provide a name for the domain (you can use any name you prefer; for example, 'testdomain.com'), and click 'Next.'

3. Set a password for the Domain Controller (e.g., 'Password1').

4. Continue by clicking 'Next' until you reach the installation page and then click 'Install.' The PC will restart after this step.

5. If everything proceeds as expected, you should now see 'Your Domain name/Administrator' as the login option."
